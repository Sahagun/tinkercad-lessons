# Simple Bowl

## Summary

**Minimum Level**: Beginner

In this lesson we will be making a simple bowl. To make things more intersting we will not be using dimensions. The goal for this project is to challange your intuition.

## Preparation

Open Tinkercad.com and creat a new project. Name the project **Simple Bowl**

During the completion of this project, keep these Learning Objectives in mind:
- Intuition


## Design

Let's get started by adding a **Half Sphere** to your Workplane.

Next, add a  **Hole Box**  to the Workplane and move it so its above the **Half Sphere** while still touching it.

![Intersecting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sahagun/tinkercad-lessons/main/simplebowl/2.png)

Use the **Group** tool on both the  **Hole Box**  and the **Half Sphere** so the **Half Sphere**  has a flat top.

Rotate you shape so its upsipde down.

Duplicate you shape and make it slightly smaller.

Make your now shape a Hole.

Use the  **Align** tool to center the two shapes in the x and z axis, while aligning the y axis to the top.

Once the shapes are aligned use the **Group** tool on both shapes to hollow out your bowl.

And you're done. Congratulations!
