# Spoon Holder

## Summary

**Minimum Level**: Beginner

In this lesson we will be making a spoon holder. Beacuse the spoons in you home are different from the spoon in my home this lesson will not be giving you dimensions. Instead you will being using measurings from your own spoon and making a custom design specifily for your spoon.

## Preparation

For this lesson you will need:
 - A large spoon from home
 - A ruler

Open Tinkercad.com and creat a new project. Name the project **Spoon Holder**

Please use this image of parts of a spoon as refernce for the design.

During the completion of this project, keep these Learning Objectives in mind:
- Measuring

## Design

Let's get started by adding a **Box** to your Workplane.

![Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sahagun/tinkercad-lessons/main/spoonholder/1.png)

Next, resize the **Box** so its flat but large enough to for the *bowl* of the spoon can fit.

Dupicate the box and resize it so its sighly smaller than the original. A good tip is to give your deign 2 millimeters or 1/16 inches around the edges. Next raise it about 2 millimeters or 1/16 inches. Make the smaller part a **Hole**.

Group your two parts.

Somewhere else on the **Workplane**, add **Box**, **Hole Cylinder**, **Hole Box** shapes.

Using a rule, measure the neck of your spoon. Using those measurments, resize your shapes so it the neck of the spoon can fit in the hole shapes. Also keep the **Box** shape is big enough for the holes while being not to thick. Use your best judgment.

Group your three parts.

Back to your first shape, add a **Box** shape that streches across the first part.

Move and align your the neck holder to the rest of your design.

Once aligned group them.

And you're done. Congratulations!
