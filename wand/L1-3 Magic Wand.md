# Magic Wand
## Summary

**Minimum Level**: Beginner

## Preparation

Open Tinkercad.com and creat a new project. Name the project **Magic Wand**

During the completion of this project, keep these Learning Objectives in mind:
- Align Tool
- Group Tool
- Torus Shape

## Design

First we will create the your star of your wand. Add a **Star** shape to your workspace. Change the **Height** to 8 mm.

Next rotate the cylinder 90 degress and make it 100 mm long.

Next we will add a ring to the wand. Add a **Torus** shape and set the **Sides** property to 24.

To make sure the ring keeps is shape and fits the rest of the wand we will scale the torus to the correct height.

- Select the Torus shape
- Select the height handle
- While holding the *shift key* change the height the 8 mm

Now we have all the parts need to finish the wand. Select all the shapes and use the **Align** tool to align the shapes.

Manually move the shapes so they overlaps eachother.

Finally group all the shapes.

Your wand should be complete and look like this:
