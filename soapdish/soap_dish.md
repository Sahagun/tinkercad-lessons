# Soap Dish

## Summary

**Minimum Level**: Beginner

We will be making a **Soap Dish** for a soap with the  dimensions 3.56 inches length x 2.19 inches width x 1.18 inches height. Feel free to adjust the dimensions for any other soap sizes.

## Preparation

Open Tinkercad.com and creat a new project. Name the project **Soap Dish**

During the completion of this project, keep these Learning Objectives in mind:
- Align Tool
- Group Tool
- Changing Units
- Box Tool

### Changing Units

By defualt, Tinkercad uses milimeters and the metric system. For this project we will be using the inches and the imperial system. To change the units in  Tinkercad click the **Settings** button on the bottom right of the workspace.

That will up the **Workspace settings** dialog box. Next to **Units**, change the the units to **Inches** . Then exit the dialog box by click on the **X** on the up right corner of the dialog box.

You should change units to what is convient for your project. Since out soap is mesaured in inces, we will be using inches. For toys or designs where the final size or dimensions don't matter the units don't matter. This is because the final design can always be scaled up or down to the final size.


## Design

### Part One - The Dish

Here we will designt the main part of this project, the dish.

Add a **Box** to your Workplane and set the following properties:
- **Radius** to 0.125
- **Steps** to 20
- **Length** to 4
- **Width** to 2.5
- **Height** to 1

Next, make a duplicate using the **Dupliacate** button or shortcut (*ctrl + D*). Make the duplicate a hole, raise it up by 1/8 inch. And set the following properties:
- **Length** to 4
- **Width** to 3.75
- **Height** to 2.25

Using the **Align** tool make sure the hole is centered and group the two boxes.

### Part Two - The Hashtag

For this part, we will design the part were the soap sits on so it can dry.

Add a **Box** to your Workplane and set the following properties:
- **Length** to 4
- **Width** to .25
- **Height** to .25

You should have made a stick that looks like this:

Duplicate it so you have two.

Duplicate again and arange them so they look like a hashtag **"#"**

### Part Three - Putting It Together

Move you hashtag to where the soap dish is.

Resize and arrange the sticks so they spaced where the soap won't fall. Once you have it, group the sticks. Then raise the hashtag half and inch. Make sure its centered to the soap dish.

**Challage:** Make openings on the soap dish the hashtag can sit inside.

When you made the openings you dish soap is done and should look like this:

And you're done. Congratulations!
